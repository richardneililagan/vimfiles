Magical.

## Usage

1. Install your choice of vim. (I personally prefer [neovim][1].)

2. Install [yarn][2].

3. Clone this repository into `~/.vim`. If you already have configuration there,
   back it up somewhere first.

4. Install [vim-plug][3].

5. `cd ~/.vim && make link`

6. Open your vim, and run `:PlugInstall`. 
   There'll be errors, because the configuration assumes plugins being already installed. That's alright.
